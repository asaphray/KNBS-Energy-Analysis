# Kenya Energy Data Analysis (KNBS)

This project analyzes energy-related datasets published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS).  
It focuses on extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data to uncover insights on Kenya's energy production, consumption, and trends.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Raw KNBS Excel files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `scripts/`: Reusable Python scripts for data loading and cleaning
- `outputs/`: Cleaned datasets, visualizations, and reports

## ✅ Goals
- Extract multiple energy tables from KNBS Excel files
- Clean and standardize datasets for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize Kenya's energy trends over time

## 🛠 Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl)
- Jupyter Notebooks
